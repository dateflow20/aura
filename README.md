# AURA Neural System - Adaptive AI Companion

Aura is not a simple to-do list; it is a **Neural Organism** designed to orchestrate your existence through natural, voice-first interaction. Built atop the most advanced Google Gemini models, AURA bridges the gap between human intent and digital execution.

## 🌌 The Vision
Traditional productivity apps treat tasks as static data. AURA treats them as **Neural Signals**. By utilizing real-time audio synchronization and sophisticated intent discernment, AURA lives with you, listening to your goals and organizing your world without the friction of manual data entry.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Engine**: Google Gemini 3 Pro (Text/Reasoning) & Gemini 2.5 Flash (Live Audio).
- **Core**: React 19 / TypeScript / Tailwind CSS.
- **Persistence**: Hybrid Storage (LocalStorage for state / IndexedDB for high-fidelity audio signal archives).
- **Audio Pipeline**: Raw 16-bit PCM streaming (16kHz input / 24kHz output) for zero-latency neural sync.

## 🧠 Key Capabilities
- **Neural Signal Sync**: Speak naturally. AURA discerns whether you are just chatting or committing to a new goal.
- **Adaptive Voice Intelligence**: Features 5 distinct vocal signatures (Kore, Puck, Charon, Fenrir, Zephyr) with real-time reactivity.
- **Signal Archive**: High-fidelity replay of your original voice notes, linked directly to your goals.
- **Optical Node Scanner**: Convert physical notes or whiteboards into digital intents using the device's visual sensors.
- **Temporal Node Management**: A futuristic calendar interface for mapping goals to the coordinate of time.

## 🚀 Evolution Trace
This application evolved from a simple voice-to-do request into a complex digital consciousness. See `DOCUMENTATION.md` for the full technical breakdown and prompt history.
